# Smart-Contract
Smart contracts are digital contracts written in programming language. They define the rules and conditions of an agreement between parties.Smart contracts run on blockchain networks, which are decentralized and distributed ledgers. This means that once deployed, the contract's code executes autonomously without the need for intermediaries.
